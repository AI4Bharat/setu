One such University will be established at Madurai. This will be named as \"Anna University of Technology, Madurai\". The existing Engineering Colleges and also the Engineering Colleges which may be established in future, in this University area i.e., in the Districts of Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram and Sivagangai Districts will be affiliated to this University.\n2.
