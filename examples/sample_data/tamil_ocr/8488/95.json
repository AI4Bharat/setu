In spite of all the sufferings that he had to undergo, he was determined never to utter a lie. One day his son died of snake-bite and Chandramati carried him to the burning ground. There Harichandra was the watchman. He asked her to pay the tax due for burning the boy on the pile. She had no money. He sent her to get it from somebody. On her way, she was alleged unjustly to have committed infanticide and arrested by the king of Benares. Arresting her, he handed her over to the Pariah Viravahu and Viravahu asked Harichandra to execute her at the place. What could Harichandra do? He could only obey the order of the Pariah. He raised the sword to execute her. At that moment Visvamitra Muni ran to him, cried \"stop, stop,\" praised him as a truthful person and gave him back his kingdom. Hence, what we learn from this is that truth alone. will succeed. We should never utter a lie and we should always speak the truth.\n"}
