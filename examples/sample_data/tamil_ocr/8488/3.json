The proposal found acceptance with the Government in view of its obvious scientific value. In the words of Sir George Grierson, \"besides the great interest that such records would arouse by enabling the languages to be heard spoken by members of the tribe concerned, they would be useful to students of languages, and to phoneticians, who would thus be put in the possession of the actual sounds used in each language, and form valuable records of languages which are liable to change, and which in future years may be extinct.\" Though steps in the direction of the recording of the languages of this Presidency were first taken in 1918, the recording was E/1-2 not done until 1922, as the Recording Expert of the Gramo- R/2-31\nphone Co. of Calcutta was not available earlier. The success which ultimately attended the work was largely due to the co-operation of the Collectors of districts, the Commissioner of Coorg, and the Translators to Government in the difficult task of training the speakers of the several dialects to do what was required for purposes of the record. The work of transliterating the passages adopting a uniform system of transliteration, conforming as far as possible to the system employed in Grierson's Linguistic Survey of India, was however a difficult one to accomplish as the persons in the districts were mostly unacquainted with the work.
