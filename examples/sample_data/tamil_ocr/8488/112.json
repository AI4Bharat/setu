As kings have little work to do, they will be very fickleminded. Such being the case, one day the king took it into his head to produce a sweet margosa fruit. Everything would be forthcoming, if the king wills it. He, therefore, took a margosa seed, made for it a special bed of sugar in his palace, planted it therein, and fed it with milk every day. After some time, the seed grew into a tree and was full of flowers and fruit. Hoping that its fruit would be sweet, the king took it and put it into his mouth. The fruit was not sweet at all, but was as bitter as poison. The moral, therefore, is that wicked people will never give up their wickedness, however much they may associate with good persons. It is why poet Vemana has said, \"Hear! O good-minded man! Though crowned and seated on a golden throne on an auspicious occasion, how can a dog give up its former\nnature?\"\nSL\n"}
