The elder son was a spendthrift. One day the house caught fire when the younger son, out of affection for his mother, .saved her from the fire, and left the village carrying the mother on his shoulders. Meanwhile the elder son had fled taking all the wealth of the house. On the way thieves waylaid him and carried away all the money after inflicting severe injuries. The younger son passed the same way and the thieves seeing him carrying an old woman took him for some god, and out of reverence placed in his hands all their booty. He soon reached a neighbouring village. The elder son after his encounter with the thieves returned to his native village and, on enquiring after his mother and brother, was directed to the village where they had gone. The younger boy asked his brother what had become of all their wealth, to which he replied that the thieves robbed him on the way. He was thereupon warned that thereafter he should not think of deceiving anybody, and all lived happily.\nसत्यमय 12\nGRAMOPHONE RECORDS\n"}
