The man is dead and gone. On Tuesday he died of dropsy in the head (or catching a serious malady). Those near and dear to the deceased beat their foreheads and breasts. A funeral pyre was made of sandalwood. The body of the deceased was washed and was taken inside (backyard) to be decorated. What a beautiful face that looked like the moon on full moon day! What beautiful eyes that looked like the star of the morning! They then brought water in a bell metal vase and put Tulsi leaves in it and the members of the family poured the heavenly water into the mouth of the deceased. After this, the fire pot was carried in advance followed by the litter. The body was taken around the pyre three times and fire was applied to it at the left side and the body was reduced to ashes. Alas! the man is dead and\ngone.\n"}
